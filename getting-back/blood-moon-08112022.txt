So, every Friday, I have been promising myself, that I would stop both drinking and smoking from tomorrow(if its Thursday) and then tomorrow(if its Friday).

So, smoke and drink to my content on Thursday and make myself believe that, its the last day, sosplurge and get sloshed in smoke and alcohol, no problem.

Come Friday, and the "Jumma Euphoria" begins and then again, I tell to myself, that come-on, today is Jumma, so let us celebrate it and call it quits from tomorrow.

So, Saturday comes, and it eventually becomes, Monday, which is the start of the week and a good point to start.

And then Monday, most of the times I have been converted to Friday, again, and again.

But, today is "Blood Moon" the Lunar Eclipse on, Tuesday;8th November 2022.It's a full lunar eclipse and there would not be any other one for next 3 odd years, ie till March 2025.

Who knows, I would be alive till then or not, and if I would be alive, or rather could be alive, then one way to make that sure,is to seriously give up on drinking and smoking.

Tomorrow is "9,11" or 9th November, while so far I have considered so many so called "auspicious" dates, to finally give up drinking, just because, they would be so called, "memorable" ones; that I have lost count, but this is certainly, the one which cannot be forgotten easily.

ITs 1900 right now, and since I woke up, I have had only 2 cigarettes, and no alcohol. Not sure, whether, I would smoke more or would have alcohol, again. Chances are very slim.

Well, because it's still winter and night falls early, so there could be changes in program. Let's see.

**Electricity is really playing truant, today evening. Let's talk about the full lunar eclipse and the blood moon. I was just about to publish this blog and also download gedit, so that I can get a word-count, but immediately the power went off again, its already the 5th time.
