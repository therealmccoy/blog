Well, today is the watershed day, as perhaps in last 67 odd months, this is the first "20th", when I am not drinking.

It does not matter that, I do not have any money to do so, because earlier also, I have tried to put into such situation,

where, I would be forced to not drink on a "20th", marking a "new
beginning on 20th", but it never happened. Specially, when I was at Ghost House, as I would be able to get a "loan".

Also, I have smoked only 1 cigarette, since morning(which is again a record, the last best was "4").

I intend to fast from tomorrow, till 31st October; as I want to mark the 1st November as the dawn of new "Mickey"; the one

who has finally able to conquer himself and start afresh.

So, today is Day 0.

I am not fasting yet, but there are Withdrawals effect already. Earlier, I would drink and smoke heavily the night before and then would 
make myself believe that, I could start fasting from next day onward easily.

I did manage to do so once, in August; most probably from 22nd August onward; and I was smoking and mostly sleeping,but i pulled it off at "Ghost House".

But, I believe, this is the fresh and new start and also, because on "20th", I absolutely don't feel like drinking, even when, I can borrow some money and do it.

But, No!
