almost all of our decisions consciously or sub-consciously has been driven by this blind assumption that we are going to be inhabitant of this planet till eternity.

whenever we take this decision, we never ponder over this fact that, what if we are living on borrowed time and in this period of time, would it be feasible enough for us to do this particular task or engage in this particular activity?

Microeconomics is all about constrained optimisation, so within the given constraints, how do we maximise the utility or efficiency?

If we apply this constrained-optimisation framework to our lives also, the entire process of decision making becomes a lot simpler, because we know now what should be the basis of our entire decision-making activity.

and we would be making a lot more wiser choices _(which may actually seem dumb to others, who have not applied this framework)_ and this is what essential to life and a whole quasi-science of microeconomics all about.

but perhaps, the entire notion of "borrowing time" goes far beyond the frame-work of constraints, because if we borrow something, we ought to payback also; and in this case, the payback means, whatever deed we do, should be worthy of living this life.

and what activities are worthy of life?

the activities which leads us ever upwards or onwards; emotionally,mentally,physically and spiritually.

all other activities should be discarded and is actually a drag on the time which we have borrowed for ourselves and shall not let us pay back our debt.

and it is not so difficult to comprehend, if we break down our lives to days, after all someone has rightly said that we live our lives as we live our days.

on so many days when we have some worthy or important tasks to do on a particular day, we cut back on frivolous ones, but just for a day, and we are back to square one on next day, we optimise within the constraint for one day and forget it the next day.

and this is because we believe that we are going to live here till eternity.

so there would be another day and another one and so on and so forth...

but since we live our lives as we live our day, if we do not optimise within this super-constraint _(that is what I would like to call the borrowed time that we have here)_ day-in and day-out, we are going to default, because at the end of day, we find that we are empty handed, because we never managed to move upwards and wonwards; physically, spiritually, mentally and emotionally!

_ps 1: i had to get up from the bed and write this because this voice was ringing in my head and would not let me sleep. perhaps this is the side-effect of keeping a journal or writing it down everywhere. it is like if you are carrying an empty vessel, then you can even run with it, but once it has even a small stone in it, walking peacefully with that stone becomes difficult; well unless you get the stone outside of the vessel._
