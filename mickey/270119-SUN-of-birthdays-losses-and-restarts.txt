On 23rd January 2019, Wednesday; I celebrated my 42nd birthday. It was spent running to the jungle in the mountains near Keri or Sweet Water lake beach, up to the famous Banyan tree, which I always wanted to visit, but never had manage to do so till now.

And then coming back, sleeping for a while, having an "Old Monk Reserve" nip and having a Veg Thali at Red Cabinn.

After the loss of the green bag which had everything I possessed or related to what I possess, it was a brutal shock to absorb. How apt that the loss, which could give rise to at least a new year and new beginning, happened just at the eve of my birthday.

My last tweet on 22nd January evening, was titled "Paradise", with a photograph of pristine blue sky, with 'top' of coconut trees in the background. And all of a sudden, within a matter of about two hours, it became a sort of "hell" with myself almost losing my bearings.

Loss is the new beginning. How would you restart, if you do not lose? Else, people would continue to lead their life in the same manner, specially in today's world, where everyone is drowned in someone else's thoughts. Only loss brings you to the perspective, the only true perspective to your life. 

Where are you?

What you want to do?

Where do you want to go?

Are you true to yourself?

Post the loss, I have been able to reassess what I have been doing for past year or so, and what I should do, in the coming year at least. In the end, the loss is your guide. How contradictory it is, ain't it?

How many restarts I had in my life, need more than ten fingers to count. It has been an extra-ordinary life so far, not in terms of achievements, but in the manner in which I have been able to live my life, on my own terms.
