Today I started to read a long article written by a Vietnam soldier on how essentially men love war. The article was very long and the way it started, it felt boorish to me. So I decided to scroll down to the very bottom and started with the last paragraph. But when you read the last paragraph, you just can't read the last paragraph only. Unlike, the first paragraph, where you can read it and leave. And the reason is very simple, because the last paragraph connects, to the earlier one in the hindsight,and if you really liked the end, you would want to connect the dots backwards, starting with the last paragraph.

And thus I managed to read a lot of the article and enjoyed it, which I had all but put down.

What does this teach us? The thought itself was so over-powering, that instead of finishing the entire article, all the way back to the first paragraph, I could not resist opening the editor and writing down this. For myself.

a. Things which generally end well, have an onerous start and may have a long and boorish tail to begin with. 
    We can relate this to so many things in our life, almost everything.

b. Whenever in doubt, begin with the end. So many times we are left dumbfounded by decisions, which seem so hard to make. 
    It's like looking up at a mountain, instead of trying to visualise the view that would be from the top.

c. Connecting dots backwards is always very easy, so if you are starting out on a very random and waylaid path and don't know how and where you are going to end up, trust in the providence and keep carrying on by going to (b) and then (a).

d. Sometimes affording yourself the luxury of the imagination that you are already on the finish line, gives enough impetus to you to actually begin a long and arduous journey, which could have been so frightful, at the starting point.

PS: Probably, I would edit this post, as and when I recollect more. For the time-being, it has done it's job by scratching my itch to write.
