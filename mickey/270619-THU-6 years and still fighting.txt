Just went through the first post of this blog and remembered, how over the years i have been fighting usually the same things, people's disdain and my quest to find solace though loneliness in alcohol.

i swing like a yo-yo, sometimes i catch hold on me and behave incredibly well, doing almost all the right things, and then i slip back in to the oblivion, hoping everyday that someone would catch me back, someone would hold me.

Like in last 1 odd year (14 months or so) I guess, when I left everything and devoted most of time, recording my thoughts on Twitter, in the hope that someone would finally understand me, that there is someone out there who would 'feel' for me.

But then, when I would not find, i would take the help of alcohol, and also because without alcohol, it was difficult to write the truth. So I wanted to write truth about myself and how I really feel, in order to find 'someone' which was not forthcoming, for which I tried further and further.

May be I found someone, but there was no confirmation, which kind of hurt me and I almost became an alcoholic recluse. 

Mostly I found that people were trying to reclaim their sorry state of lives, through my life tales and through my behaviour, they would confirm their 'affirmation' through their 'sly tweets' but would lack courage to come more further. 

They knew that i have been under alcohol addiction, but for them that was just another line in the story, of a generation which is now lost in TV Series.

I am not going back to them, ever again ! They do not deserve me, such selfish people.

So after all these years, I am again trying to get out of this alcoholism.

Its been 2 days, that I have not had a drop of alcohol, today is the third day, and I am going to continue this.
