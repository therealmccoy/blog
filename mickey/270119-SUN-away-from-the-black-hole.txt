Since the theft of the green bag from the beach on 22nd January evening, I am away from the black-hole called the “Smart Phone”.

It is a forced one, and brought about by a sudden thrust from the destiny, or due to my carelessness or whatever, and hence it is painful till now, as I was not prepared for it.

But since the loss of my 3 year old smart-phone, which I have not used for almost half of that period deliberately, due to my disgust of smartphones, I have been deliberating, what the incident meant to me?

Specially on Twitter, I was getting really sunk, writing my daily briefs of my life, which I could have done here on the blog. And then when I was away, my thoughts would revolve around the kind of tweets which I would probably write over there.

So even when I was away, I was not away. 

The smartphone is the most deadliest ghost ever been known to mankind, people know it but don't want to exorcise it. Thankfully for me, the jolt from the destiny has again provided me this opportunity to experience the vacuum, which appears when there is no mobile phone.

How big a "Black Hole" a smart-phone is can only be gauged, when you throw it out from your life.

Since then I don't require to fidget with my phone all the time, staring down. I don't need to listen to music all the time, just because I can.

Most of the times, the bitter and tough things happen to bring you back on a path which is right for self. It's like a sudden swerve you take to avoid a mishap or a collision.

I believe the loss of my smartphone on 22nd January 2019 evening, was that one incident of it's kind.
