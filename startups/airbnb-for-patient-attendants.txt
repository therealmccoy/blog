Just about last month, I had to visit two hospitals in Goa; the district hospital at Mapusa and then GMCH at Bambolim. 

I was there to do whatever I can, to help, a local friend, whose mother was ill (who later passed away).

Being there, at both the places I observed that while the patient is in deep agony, the attendants(those who come with patients to attend to them) are also in pain in similar wavelengths, one for the fact that their loved one is in agony and second, in hospitals just no one cares about the attendants.

Few rare private hospitals might still have a cubical or a bed to spare of at night for the attendant (+n) (+1 is allowed with patient, though she has to sleep most probably on the floor) but at Government hospitals, there is no such facility.

Most of the family members of the patients have to do away by sleeping on the floor at night, at almost all government hospitals (May be AIIMS could be different, but I have a doubt) and most of the private hospitals.

In this hour of agony, what is needed, is at least a comfortable bed to sleep on (though, it is difficult to say, whether the attendants can even asleep in this distress) for the patients attendants.

Connecting backwards, While tending to my father who suffered with cancer and later on passed away, I too spent a few nights on the hospital floor during chemotherapy session at a very good private hospital, when the private rooms were not available and the chemo session was elongated.

An AIRBNB for patient attendants could be started as a NOT FOR PROFIT enterprise to provide succour to millions of people all around the country.

Is there a way to do it? Probably!

Abhi Out,

PS:Either we establish that this can be done and we start it or else we prove, that this cannot be done. Both ways, it would be great learning adventure.
