People are making friends from all kind of online sources, but still, loneliness is currently the biggest disease afflicting the planet.
Why?
The current system of algorithmic daing or friend-making is not working apparently.

** What happens if people are matched according to their interests, they are brought together in a light-familiar-easy place like Goa and then they stay together and do a set of activities together?

What we can call it as as '2Cation'. 2 random people come together, stay together and become friends.

** What current dating apps and systems lack is that all the interactions are ephemeral and they do not result into anything concrete, which leads to heartburn and disappointment, then people try harder and it gets into a vicious cycle. The problem is that to find new companions or friends, who could be potential cure to LONELINESS, nothing new has been tried out.

** Unless people stay together and do some activity together, it is not possible to know each other through a series of texts and posts, which could be often dressed up for impacts. But when is in front of each other, literally 24x7, then faking for how long? It is so easy to fake on dating apps!

** THis could be like REALITY DATING, minus all the buzz and glitz of media.

** Bring people to serene locations like Goa, (where they are excited to go and spend some time, during the off-season, to avail the cheap rentals). People are also relatively free during such 'off-season' times.

** TWIST: While matching the people together; we ask people what kind of people they are and then match them with people having diverse tastes and NOT similar tastes.

** People are grouped according to their age brackets, and activities are designed according to it.
