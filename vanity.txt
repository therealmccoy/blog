almost all of our decisions consciously or sub-consciously has been driven by this blind assumption that we are going to habitate this planet till eternity.

whenever we take this decision, we never ponder over this fact that, what if we are living on borrowed time and in this period of time, would it be feasible enough for us to do this particular task or engage in this particular activity?

Microeconomics is all about constrained optimisation, so within the given constraints, how do we maximise the utility or efficiency?

If we apply this constrained-optimisation framework to our lives also, the entire process of decision making becomes a lot simpler, because we know now what should be the basis of our entire decision-making activity.
