Today, I woke up at just about 0500 and immediately went to reading "To Kill A Mocking Bird" and after reading it for an hour, I got down to reading online newspapers, while having tea. Unlike other days, I did not went back to sleep. It was still partly cloudy.

I am having TROUBLE SLEEPING for past few days, and even though yesterday I did not sleep in afternoon, it was difficult getting a sound sleep. I am not being able to decipher the reason for that, probably because I am not doing any work, like not even walking. There is no physical activity at all. Since the rain started again, the lifestyle has been all sedentary. The physical activity lastes only 11 days, from 17th August till 28th August 2019.

Today morning, after having tea, went out to beach and Matthew uncle followed behind shortly, the Chandra PAtrem was fishing along with his son, and old guy of Francis crew (black skinned). I wa snot in a mood to talk to Uncle and he guessed that, I sat for a while and then proceeded to walk North. Even though water was up a lot, and almost there was no place to walk on the beach, I thought that may be I would walk as far as possible till sweet lake.

Between the Lifeguard cabin and shacks, I FOUND A PUMPKIN, a small cute orange ones, which I saw at Pernem, when I went with Elder Budke for Matoli purchase. They looked so cute and I wanted to buy them, but they were selling for Rs.100 a piece or so, and I had to curb my emotion then. And here today, my wish was fulfilled in an unexpected manner. I picked it up and it looked like fresh, yesterday was the 7th DAY IMMMERSION and it seemed someone put it our yesterday only. I picked it up and then near the cliff, I washed it again and it looked so pretty.I carried it all the way to Sweet Lake and back in my hand.

I also picked 2 PLASTIC CONTAINERS, small transparent one, one has the lid and other did not, it looked like camphor containers.

My lunch was prepared even before I went to the market, which is a NEW RECORD. Since the electricity was not there as I returned for a while, I decided to have tea, as it drizzled a bit and then I proceeded to cut the pumpkin and make it's Subji and Rice.Today's budget was Rs.100, since I did not go to market yesterday.

I indulged myself by buying a Rs.10 Bourbon biscuit pack and a Rs.10 papad pack, which I did not eat so far. The Subji was really good, even though I used sparse oil and only 1 small onion. About a Katori is left for tomorrow.

There has not been any definite news from Ankit of Upscale yet, he again asked me a question today that what I wanted from the job at his company; I replied financial sustenance and learning opportunity. There has not been any reply till 1730.

I FINISHED THE BOOK, "How To Kill A Mocking Bird" and though the book I believe is primarily meant for early stage kids, nevertheless, it is a nice book. In less than 1 WEEK, IT IS THE 2nd BOOK that I read COMPLETE. So much of time is now available, as I am not spending time tweeting.

I RETURNED Rs.100 to Lanky-Takloo fellow, who had given it to me to buy crackers for Saibini (I could have very well kept it!).

Matthew Uncle was today morning, happy that weather has been inconsistent and boats have not been going out due to that, and folks are earning less money. I mean, c'mon; HOw SICK? I see it again here, after Sanjay K. PARADISE OF ROTTEN PEOPLE.

I am not feeling too hungry, right now, but I feel like cooking. If I cook now, then I already have the Subji and then tomorrow morning, I need not cook and hence can spend entire time loafing.

There has not been any reply from Josh, regarding my email of Vinyl records and players rental business.

Spent some time with Francis Crew brothers in the evening, after a walk till the cliff. they said, there would be another 3 odd days, before the sea is calm enough to go out. There has been a lot of waves, at present. It almost did not rain today, except a few drizzling.
