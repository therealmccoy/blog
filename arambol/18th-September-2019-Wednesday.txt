Almost after 8 days, that I have started writing again here. Though these intervening days also meant, shifting to 'Mickey's Landing' and being ready emotionally and physically, akin to being settled; I believe, I also wasted a lot of time in tweeting, which I believe was the last spark or the ragge of fire, before it swindles down.

I no more intend to write the 'Daily Log' on Twitter.

Removed @ishabhansali_ and @LettersOfNote from Twitter handle. Replaced them with Mason and Austen Allred.
I have also now locked my account. I do not tweet, does not mean that people have access to whatever I have written over there in a long period of time. 
Also, the DM now stands closed.

SONIA was washed twice, some kerosene oil sprayed and it was brought to Mickey's Landing at around 1900. Driving. All systems, operating fine.

I feel like celebrating, more about the SONIA's home-coming and some little bit about EXITING almost from Twitter. That is with a NIP of RUM, but I am waiting, that it may happen that Patrem might come with a drink proposal, since he called in the afternoon (just a random call).
