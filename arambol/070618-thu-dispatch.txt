The satellite picture of IMD which I have attached to this post is the updated one at 1800 hrs. I do not have any idea in which direction that big blob of cloud to the left of Arabian coast is going to move, but most probably it is going to impact Goa, to what extent only the time can tell. It still seems a bit far but I guess anything can happen in nature and very fast. I have not even tried to find out where and how that cloud mass would move, or is that a Cyclone.

Ignorance is bliss. I am not overtly worried since I have an umbrella, with which I could walk down a kilometre or so.

I have enough tea,coffee and sugar to last about 3 to 4 days and rice for about 2 to 3 odd days, but I have run out of rudimentary spices and potatoes. If it rains really hard, the vegetables would run out, both which are available at local farmers, as well as which comes from Karnataka. But off late, I have become found of pulses and I can do with it. I also bought enough of candles and a box of match-box, so nights are not an issue, but in just about 2 days time I would run out of anti-mosquitoes incense sticks also. I have enough of AAA batteries for the torch also, to last a couple of odd days.

Electricity should not play much of a truant, but this looks quite severe and hence potable water for me could become an issue, since with excess rains the well water gets murky too.

I wanted to go to market to get some necessary stuff to stock myself for the onslaught, but then got lazy. Lets see what is the weather like in the morning and even if it is mildly raining, would go and get some stuff.

But whatever, this surely looks like fun...
