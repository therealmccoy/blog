1. The rains started dripping at just around 0245 hrs. It started slowly and soon within 5 minutes or odd, it was quite a downpour, accompanied by large winds. I woke up just about that time and remembered that wooden mat was still out there hung ont he railing of the deck and rushed out to save it, vaguely hoping that it would have survived, last few minutes, and well luckily it did, but it was already wet. Also my shoes were out there as well, and brought them also inside.

2.Soon, the electricity supply was cut-off because of the large winds blowing, as a safety measure and I switched on my little solar lantern and sat at the door of the room, trying to soak in the first rains of the Monsoon. Technically it is the pre-monsoon shower though. The lightning was like a tubelight flickering continuously, which means lightning was occurring almost every half a second or so somewhere over the sea.

3. The wind was really cool and after a while, I put on the shirt. I had to drag myself inside the room a bit because the rains were now really loud. And though I seriously detest capturing photographs, I just could not resist capturing this spectacle and put came my mobile phone which was on "Aeroplane" mode thankfully, else it would have ran out of juice. I first captured a couple of snaps, then a sound clip and then a 5 minute video of the lightning flashes occurring continuously. I have not reviewed the video yet, so not sure how it came. Though it was pitch dark due to electricity supply being switched off, most of the flashes might have been just mild enough to escape the lens. I have not reviewed the video and sound recording yet.

4. Soon the electricity was restored but not to my room, which meant that there was some fault in the supply to guest-house. But it was cool enough to survive without the fan. I opened the windows and tried to sleep, post 0430 hrs I guess.

5. Prior to this spectacle, all of a sudden at night, it became very hot. Like really hot. Though my window was closed (because of mosquitoes), but it never had been so hot earlier. I believe it was quite a warning to the impending storm.

6.Just at around 0400 hrs or so, I saw one of the local out with his headlamp, searching for mangoes good enough to pick up. Mangoes had fallen all around and for a while I was tempted to go down but, decided not to. He already had a big half sackful of them. This was his opportunity, when every one was sleeping.

7. By the time I woke up at around 0900 hrs, most of the good mangoes were gone (picked up). The electricity supply was still not back, but I learnt from landlady the guest-house electricity supply had an issue, and soon the guys from the Electricity Department would come to fix it.

8. The street was littered with aftermath of onslaught, with broken branches and leaves strewn all over and literally littered with mangoes, almost all of them raw ones.

9. My bike also withstood the onslaught of the rain and thankfully it was not damaged by any projectile.

10. There was one shoulder slung black colour bag lying dirty on the ground. It was a good one and must have been swept away by the winds. I washed it and hung it over the railing. Later in the afternoon as I was on the deck, after finishing cooking my lunch, luckily the owner of the bag spotted it and I returned it to her. She was so happy and was thanking profusely. For her it might just have been a miracle to find her bag again, which must have been associated with so many travel stories. Literally, a bagful of stories!
