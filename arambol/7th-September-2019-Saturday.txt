Yesterday, there was no electricity since almost 0800 to 1500 hrs. The Arti of Ganpati has just finished, as I was at Dabholkar's for lunch that electricity came back. Hence most of the early morning was spent, either sulking, or lying in bed, since it was raining heavily out, being dark.

Yesterday, I had been waiting for the 'Lunch Call' to come and indeed, Arabian came at 1400 hrs, to tell me that I should come for lunch at 1330 hrs. That was so sweet and cute. By this time, I had received miss-calls also from Patrem, which I would get to know later only. Probably it was rains or my phone has been like 'wet' due to rains, that it seems that it has some temporary short-term 'ringing' loss!

The lunch at Dabholkar's was just of this world. Their daughter has also come down from Bombay, with her family. I have often wondered in this week, that if one gets to eat such delicious veg dishes, who would want to have non-veg, specially the idiotic Broiler?

It is 1803 now, and it is drizzling. It has never stopped raining since last night. For past couple of days, the leaf of Mr.Wilson on the tin-roof, makes strange and spooky noise, as and when Mr.Wilson moves (or sways) in the wind and the leaf rubs against the tin. ITs like a big vehicle screeching to a halt sometimes and during rain, it is spooky as hell.

Yesterday evening and on the 3rd immersion of Ganpati in waters, that I got to carry him, all the way in to sea, in dark. Last year, I was not prepared and prior to that, I was a stranger. It seems, I finally belong. In fact Paandu, exhorted others to let me carry the Ganesh idol. Avdhoot (the elder Budke) even asked me to play the those two Arti-bells.
Perhaps it is because he knows that he is getting old and after his daughter's marriage, it is only me, who is going to look after him (probably) because rest do not like him much.

Yesterday, even the dinner was out, at Budke's. Else I had planned to skip it since I had too much to eat in the afternoon and then those really 'heavy' prasads post Visarjan. But then, I relented and acquiesced to the request of Patrem. Sometimes I wonder that probably he has really at least some genuine affection for me, since his leg episode, because of the way I helped him and kept company. Probably that feeling is more pronounced on festivals, when he might be thinking of his bad days, not so long ago and then all those things remind him of me.

The quantum of crackers burst by both Dabholkar and Budke family was mind-boggling. It was crazy. I was happy with my POP. It is made-in-india and it is so cute. Seeing me POP it, event he ladies started popping it.

It is also now almost complete 7 days over, since I logged out or de-activated twitter. But since it is not one of those longest spell, so still, it is not much to mention.

Today, after coming back from Mapusa, I went to market to make Tehri, still on my Rs.50/day allowance (I believe, I would complete 17 days this time, it was 18 last time), I had a little extra to indulge and I decided to buy half-kg of tomatoes which costed me Rs.15, that means Tomatoes are now Rs.30/Kg. They are not fresh kind, but a tomato is a tomato.

I have also completed 6 DAYS 'NOAL', which is not having alcohol for 6 straight days. This is I believe first in more than 15 or 16 months, even more. This is the biggest accomplishment of mine in as many months perhaps, apart from being able to survive here.

I am thankful of having some clean clothes, I wonder, if I did not have that gap of 2-3 days, when it did not rain, then what would have happened of my clothes?

[1915] It is raining heavily again, and I do not think that I would be going for Saibini prayer. I have not gone there since 4th September, Wednesday; when instead I attended the Bhajans at Dabholkars. It is raining really cats & dogs right now, and Mr.Wilson's leaf is making strange noises again.
