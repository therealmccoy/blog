1. It rained quite heavily at night, starting just about 2130 hrs or so. It began slowly and gently and then it became wild. The pattern was same, it becomes extremely humid and hot, just before the cool wind starts sweeping in, bringing the rains along with them. Lightning was not as persistent as on the first day, but it was compensated by a couple of loud booms. It again lasted for about an hour and half, and then subsided. Electricity was cut-off for brief periods of high intensity, but soon it was restored.
I slept with my windows open, since it was quite cold and mosquitoes don't like cold weather.

2. Within last one month or so, there has been three weddings at Girkarwada. On 5th April, it was wedding of a girl, a week or so ago, of a boy and then today there is again one wedding, but I don't know the person on whom this misfortune has befallen yet. Yesterday was Rose ceremony and for most part of the day, Konkani songs kept playing on the loudspeaker. Just they would have been about to finish, it started raining heavily. Wonder, it did not spoil the ceremony.

3. There were couple of brave hearts out during the mini-storm, hunting for mangoes. So much to risk for few mangoes, it is quite insane to me. There are branches which can fall down, and then coconuts, one can slip over the rocks; the list goes on and on. But still these guys were out with their torches. Amazing! And then jsut about the start of wind blowing, out came couple of scooter born "Mango Hunters", trying to find as many mangoes as possible, before it starts pouring.

The thing with human greed is that it is never enough for most of the people, the quest to get more and more, eventually destroys the peace and serenity of their life, but the misery is that they are not going to realise until they are on their death-bed and by then it is too late. This is why most of the people dread dying, because then they realise that they wasted their lives, never managed to "live".

5. The beach looks marvellous in the evening, since all the shacks, except the "Negi" is gone. Also all the tourists and hence it is open space, like having a private beach just for myself. Definitely a dream come true.

6. The best part of the evening at the beach nowadays is to watch the birds go home flying over the sea, north. I wonder where they go, somewhere between Keri and Redi, in the jungles I suppose. What a marvel it is, how much strength it would require, and then there is no place to fail. Sometimes I wonder, why they fly all over the sea? They could just simply take the easier and less dangerous path over the land?
And these birds keep changing the position in the pelican. The one who is at front, goes behind and the one at the back, takes it place. this way, no one tires constantly and then entire pelican is able to move home. This change is taking place continuously, one or two birds at a time and this "change of points-man" is itself a marvel to watch.

Yesterday, there was a small Russian family of husband-wife and their small daughter came in the afternoon, near the guest-house, parked their bike and started looking for mangoes. I decided to do something to surprise them. I took six mangoes from the refrigerator, went and kept them on the floor of their scooter and came back. Then they went towards beach and were gone for long. I finished my lunch went for my one hour siesta, almost forgetting about them. And then I woke up after about a hour or so, just nick in time as the Russian family was taking off with their scooter. The lady had a black polythene bag in her hand, presumably filled with mangoes, included those of mine and there was a broad smile on her face :-)

8. At the evening, there was a lady in black gown with her very small daughter in white frock and the lady would try to induce her to dance by herself moving round and round and the kid would follow her mom and sometimes she would go fast, unable to control herself and would fall on the sand. Most beautiful sight in recent days. The pair of black-and-white.

9. The days of carrying the umbrella are back, at the shore you never know, when it would start pouring and this comes from experience of last year, getting drenched a few times.

10. I was wondering last evening that I could fix a small shed made of plastic sheet or gunny bag as a shade, where the "Love Beach Shack" is lying closed, if sometimes I want to spend the day, writing over there with pen and paper. That place is now exclusively for the use of myself, at least for next six months.
