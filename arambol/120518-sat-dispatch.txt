1. It has been cloudy and humid in the morning, with hardly noticeable breeze, unless one is sitting outside. My little friend "Sooraj" does not like to be addressed as "Commando", obviously he does not know the meaning of it. Today he categorically told me, "My name is Sooraj and not Commando". Sometimes when I have to finish some chore, including writing this newsletter, I just tell him that his mother just saw him here and off he goes running. I know I am cheating him, but I believe it is better than ignoring him and keep doing on my things. After all he is my friend!
