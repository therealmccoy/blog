Today, since morning, it has been almost DARK and raining heavily, albeit intermittently. There has been a lot of noise due to the lintel work in progress of Felix GH, which started in the morning, and finished just after about 530 or so. Even though, the other construction workers (the regular ones) make so much of noise that, it is only a small respite.

Sometimes, I wonder, that why do they make so much of noise? Can't they work at quiet? But it seems like we use a variety of tools like SM, Newspaper, Videos etc to drown our inner voice; they use 'talking loudly' to drown their inner voice, specially when they might be seeing around everyone else, having a easier time (physically) and they having a tough one. So far, it has been a miracle that I have resisted shouting at them, even when I have been drunk and almost shouted at them.

Today is the 5th day and in just about 6 hours, it would be over, wherein I have not tweeted anything, ie logged out of Twitter. It's not new and previously, I have done longer stints, but this time, I have effectively bonded myself in something which is akin to burning the bridges (Posting the pics of Lina on Twitter).

I have not eaten anything since morning, as I waited for the lunch call to come from Patrem for the Chaturthi series of lunch, but it did not come. I believe he is angry at myself going to Dabholkar's yesterday instead of him. I mean, it is ok dude. I had lunch at your place a day before also, and how can I say 'No' to someone, while saying 'Yes' to you? They are also nice people. And only during such occasions that I go to them. And moreover, they do not expect anything in return either.
Also, he saw me yesterday evening also, as I was attending the Bhajan ceremony (or was about to) at Dabholkar's. I mean hell to you, and what you think. Had it not been raining, then I would have gone to market and bought rice and cooked.
I have 3 cups of tea since morning, and I am almost on the verge of having one more, and I do not mind that because I have already extra rations of tea and sugar with me.

I have not been able to read as much as I would have wanted to. But I still have last 2 hours of today, and I would read from 2200 to Zero Hundred. But at least, I am continuing with it, that's the main thing.

Also, today is the 5th consecutive day, without ALCOHOL and that would be a record in more than a year now. NOAL as what I call it.

So it is about time for the Saibini prayer, and it started raining and now drizzling and I really am not inclined to go out for prayer. I already have potatoes boiled and the utensils cleaned and probably I would start to cook my food.

The LED bulb which I wrapped with Orange paper looks real good out. It would have been nice to sit outside with tea, had it not been raining. May be write in the note-book as well.

Surprising Sanjay.K has not come with Ganpati sweets, ha ha ha ha ! Last time, when he came late in the afternoon, as I came back from SSV-GH, with a katori of Chutney, ostensibly desiring to ask me, about my trip over there (or probably that i would myself tell it, though i am not as foolish any more. With stupids, I act further stupid.). Now that was like real late, past 1400 and that's no time to bring chutney. Obviously he would have come to check over me earlier and found the door locked and then came back again.
Also, I was having Feni and had keep the rest of the Nip inside the refrigerator and did not even ask him, nor did I tell him. I guess, he got the message, that he has been pestering for long. That stupid 'call', "Haan, Bhaaiji !".
And most irritating thing, he is NEVER LISTENING, he always comes with his own PURPOSE and is interested solely in it. FUCKING SELFISH guy.
Also, for the fact that, he is a SADIST.
