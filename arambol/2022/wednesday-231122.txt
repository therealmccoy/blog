======================================

1. Saw the "Gujju" guy from Bombay, who used to stick with Ridhima, in the morning, as I was again going to Tito. I thought, that he would stop by and say, "Hello!" etc, but he pretended that he did not see me at all.

Obviously, he would do so, because I never replied to his WA forwards.

2. Again, quite cloudy, it does not seem, that it would rain, but humid though.

3. Again, did not go to beach in the morning, to get fish. Its been eons since, I have been wanting to go, or telling myself, that I would go, but then don't. Because, I get drunk at night, and don't wake up, rather arise.

Tomorrow is a good time though, let's see. I have so far quit Drinking, as of today.

4. **I HAVE TO COMPLETELY TRANSFORM MYSELF, BY MY BIRTHDAY.WHICH MOSTLY MEANS QUITTING DRINKING AND SMOKING. THE MISSION HAS STARTED TODAY. LET'S SEE.

This time,it should work, because, now I am completely at peace, with no worries of a "roof over head" or a sustained income. Also, I am at a place, where actually, I can reside at peace. At SAMADHAN.

5. Yesterday, I saw that maid of Anant (the very irritating one, who talks non-stop) was going to throw away the "MOTICHOOR LADDOOS", there must be at least a 20 of them, but imagine, there was not a single one given to me, on the day of inaugration ie 6th November 2022; SUNDAY.

6.**EMAILS SENT**
=================

a) To Kailyin, giving the feedback of latest issue of Positive Donut.

b) To Nilesh, author of Workonomics on Substack.

7. As I am approaching 1200 hrs, and because I still have money, I am again getting tempted to drink and call it a day, tomorrow onwards, when I resume the "BOAT DUTY". It always happens with me. 

8. **KALYAN** Two consecutive days, The number has been starting from digit "6".It was 68 on Monday and 62 yesterday. No pattern has been visible so far yet. 

**1428 HRS**
==================

9. Failed yet again in the mission and bought 2XRs.30 KAJU(PK from Ocean Distillers) and also a pack of cigarettes. Cooking "TEHRI" with Potatoes + Tomatoes+ Soybadi.

**10. I believe, I have found my calling. NOW...

I HAVE TO SURVIVE OR LIVE 1 YEAR AND JUST FULFILL THE DREAM OF HEDGE FUND. I HAVE NO OTHER AGENDA. 

11. ** i NEVER HAD ANYONE TO SUPPORT ME, OR LEND A HAND OR BE WITH ME(without any selfish reaon);I am talking about EMOTIONALLY here. And the status quo remains. Tried a lot. But failed. Now, It's me and only me.

**12. I AM THE DELTA.**

**1806 HRS**

That's what happens, always with me. When drunk, all gung ho and next day, all fizzles out. Had that stupid Spirit and lunch and now feeling like shit. Also, feeling like, drinking again, but obviously.

**1809**

Next excuse, St. Francis Xavier's Mass is starting from tomorrow, and hence, my revival shall begn from tomorrow.
