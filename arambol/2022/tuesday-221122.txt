====================================

There is certainly a hardware problem with the Acer laptop. Now, even with the battery plugged-in, it is crashing and I have no idea, how to solve it.

I know, that due to the power issue, te hard disk is not starting, but I don't have any clue,how to solve it without banging the hard-disk and running the risk of ruining another disk.

The other computer is running fine, as long as power does not disconnects.

Kailyn replied and for the first time, she asked : "Hope you are doing well?" at the end of the email.

Th disk is starting after given a pause, but I am not being able to gauge whether power supply is being made or not.

Very cloudy today, and it seems, it would rain.

The machine started, but now I have absolutely no idea, how long it would last. And surely, enough,it konked again.

Well, nothing can be done. I tapped on the disk again, out of habit, but gently. Due to the mother-board, this disk should also not get corrupt.

The update is that, I was able to fix the power cord and run the "CHDSK" and it fixed the error of the disk and the system was able to start properly.

Met SATBIR, yesterday morning, as I was going to market to get stuff. He was driving in the car, reversed and we shook hands. He told me that, he has ought a land parcel/property in Arambol and said that he wants me to meet him, and that he would ping me later. The rendezvous time was 2200 hrs, but I did not get any ping from him.
