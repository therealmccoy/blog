Well, Saturday night was a complete surprise, as around 2020, as I was just about to turn off the 'Tehri' on cooking stove, Patrem shouted from below, as it was raining heavily. It was his 'baby's drinking night out' after 40 days. I did the duty assigned to me, of fetching things. We sat inside as it was raining heavily outside. In the meanwhile, when I was out to fetch the things, Sanjay K also came with fried Mackerel and Patrem took the fish from him and said, he would deliver it to me.
He was hurrying as usual, and in the meanwhile had received the phone call reminder for dinner. I had barely finished half of the RS. after he went, I had the rest of it, gingerly. Which also mean, the Old Monk rum which I brought in afternoon, was still there, for Sunday afternoon. even though, I wanted to make it drink-free. I would ahve kept it like that way, had the OM was not there.

It was rainy day yesterday also, but thankfully kind of quite, may be because it was a Sunday.I even went out in the evening to shore, just for a while, we moved out as the black clouds just started to hover.

I was not sure, whether Saibini prayer would be held yesterday evening or not, as Francis and his brother told me that this was big night and it would be celebrated with food and drinks. I had absolutely no recollection of cake cutting ceremony, which used to happen since last 2 years, and I had been witness. Since it was not raining and when the crackers fired up, I went down. A lot more people were there and the fare dished out at end, was much than the usual namkeen. There ws cake and Samosa (made by Sanjay K). SanjayK wanted to talk about me Saturday night Patrem episode, but I did not pay heed to him and perhaps after a while he got the clue. sometimes he acts in such foolish and stupid manner, like last evening when he saw an acquaintance taxi driver from HP, turning his taxi from the statue, he recognised him, and started a small conversation, even though when prayer was going on and taxi was blocking the road and the ceremony. So stupid. He wanted to show that he also knows so many people (which are absolutely worthless to him, since his own brothers are worthless to him). He is FAKING all the time and now I am seriously detesting his company.

Yesterday, I wrote to this Child Cancer Patients non-profit called 'SabrCare' to work as a volunteer. I also wrote to them again that, I could help them with YC application, and though hey don't need me for that, they should definitely apply to that. Then I sent SMS to Celine, regarding starting a Cancer non-profit in Goa; since she had mentioned that I should work with a NGO. I have not heard from her since then.

Yesterday night, I had so much to eat, that I did not cook anything. Watched "The PErks Of Being A Wallflower" movie and the book is definitely much better than the movie; and the movie was definitely being produced to shore uo the sales of the book, since anyone who has not read the book would not be able to make heads or tails of the movie. I started watching 'The Mindhunters' TV series (which is originally on NEtflix) but it's Episode 2 itself, failed to laod and then I gave up.It was difficult to even finish the 'Wallflower' movie, because I had read the book and movie was not to it's liking.

I am so happy for the fact that I still have tomatoes, ad for a big change, I could make a subji with Tomato in it.

** I have DECIDED to follow intermittent-fasting ritual, post lunch from today; since there would not be any distraction, as both Ganpati and Saibini celebrations are over. The only breaks would be if Patrem comes sometimes.

[1108] Also, today is the 9th day, that I have remained logged out of Twitter and in spite of heavy inducements, I have decided not to go back. after all, "Itni kurbat thi, to itna faasla kyon tha?"

Josh sent the photograph of the 2nd vehicle his company bought. Tata ACE XL. With complete body. I replied to him.

** RED LETTER DAY, as it is now like in much more than a year, that I did not sleep post lunch, and that too when I walked in the afternoon from 1230 to 1400, to the end of Sweet Lake beach. Amazing.

Took a mid-afternoon walk after having finished cooking lunch, it was from the 'boat' to sweet lake. Went half-naked and was quite a spectacle. Could already spot a few 'white girls'. A few tourists were also there. Went up to the end of SL beach, where couple of folks were fishing in very shallow waters over the rocks. Spotted the tiny fishes, from the water running from the SL to sea.

Ankit of Upscale was supposed to chat with me, but he did not. The usual trick in the book, which I hate so very much. This just drives up my bargaining quotient. silly tricks of 'Zero Sum Guys'. Makes it so very easy to spot one (ZS guy).

I have again shut the front door, in order to avoid Sanjay K.

KK followed me back to GH both the times, during the afternoon and in evening, in fact in evening he was waiting for me nearby. He sat close to me, even when it rained, taking a bit of shelter in the umbrella shade.

Evening was nice, yellow one, but like always the sun set soon, behind the clouds. Surprisingly even after not sleeping and having read so much, I am not feeling sleepy. I have already logged more than 5 hours on Toggl, as of now.
