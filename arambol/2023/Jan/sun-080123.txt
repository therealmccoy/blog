=> did not meet Krishna, as he left yesterday morning. He was not to be seen at shore, last evening, which sort of confirms that he left. Though he left couple of messages on WA, including that he is leaving on Saturday, but I just did not feel like meeting him.

I was there on shore at Friday evening, and even Krishna was loitering around. I was just hoping that he does not see me, and since it was late and dark, so it's most probably, he was not there.

It was full moon night, and I was out on the shore for quite a long time, but it seems he went early to LT or to his usual cafe.

=> After a while, almost everyone went in to LT or somewhere else, and I was alone, with the petite Russian girl (who is a musician and sings as well and comes here, every year). She was sitting and sort of meditating and after a while, got up and danced for a while.

=> The moon was really magnificient and watched the rise to the bloom a lot. Had a 90 of OM at shore, the very first time, in a very long time, at shore. If I would have had another 90, then probably would have stayed longer.
There was a firang girl, probably Israeli who seemed interested and crossed my post a few times, she wore nice rimmed glasses.

=> Came back and had a nip of OM again.Probably made, Aaloo-Tamatar, but don't remember fully.

=> The Spaniard "Zero-Haircut" lass was also not to be seen yesterday, she was not to be seen even day before yesterday.

=> Frecko was playing at Surf Shack on Friday evening, and he did not seem in his usual element because of the lack of crowd, the kind he used to get at Twice or This Is It. I did not wait.

=> Yesterday, had a nice surprise in the morning, as I saw that views on 99Goa blog touched 10 views, previous day. I was very happy. So far, in 6 days, I posted 6 posts.

=> Got Cauliflower for the first time in probably 2 years, and cooked kind of Tehri in evening, but put more than required water and also more than required salt.
Tata Salt is so free-flowing and good looking that, one tends to put more. Happened the same stuff in afternoon also, with the Sundrop Oats that I brought again.

=> Going to start the Water-Only-Fast from tomorrow. Monday and a Niner, it is an auspicious moment.

=> I pinged Josh on Friday night, as in whether he was coming to Goa the coming week and he said that he would confirm on Monday. Which probably menas might not come.

=> I have started tagging ministers, departments and officials in my 99Goa tweets.

=> DRISHYAM 2 CREATIVE DIRECTOR : The guy who was living in G5(Pawan's apartment) left for his abode at Mandrem, and prior to that talked a bit with me. More than curious, he wanted to tell about himself, as I never approached him or asked him anything. He asked me to get going on "SCRIPT WRITING" and I have decided to take it as a project.

=> WATCHED : WASP NETWORK on Netflix. Penelope Cruz was as always stunning. The movie is based on true story.

=> SONI : HAve also watched the movie "SONI" earlier this week, which I forgot to log.

=> LAST NIGHT: Whole night, Sleep music was playing on Spotify on tab,and I had some nice dreams, which in fragments I remembered till I woke up.

=> The "Kaali Dancer", Indian who wears red swimsuit and lives at LT, arrived yesterday. Saw her at shore for first time.

=> The Sun is again mild and lovely today.
