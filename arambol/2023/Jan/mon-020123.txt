  => So, today is the second consecutive day, that I am writing this blog. Never happened last year, as far as I recall.
  =>Did not meet Krishna for 2 days, 31st Dec and 1st Jan. I informed him that I would be there at shore, at LT, the usual place, but till I was there, he was not to be seen. Later he messaged way back at night, that why I did not call, and he was there but he did not find me. I did not reply.
  =>In the evening, the Spanish lass was there, but she did not come close enough for me to wish her HNY. In fact, for a change, I was sitting way ahead, close to the shore. I wait, for her to leave, and then only start going back home.
  =>When the garbage is cleared, like yesterday evening, it makes me feel happy. Yesterday evening, again as I was about to move to shore, I heard the whistle and and scrambled to call the guys to Samadhan. Got the garbage picked up, even though was a bit late for shore.
  =>Evening rush was still there, but not that much as on 31st. Today it should be much quieter. Saw a nice Indian lass, playing "Dhapli" at "Drum Circle" but left soon.
  =>Yesterday evening also, drank and smoke, in the same manner of starting from "Monday".
  ****MUSK : Suggested to Muskey, the error on "Twitter Views" when on F5 the view number increases, even while on the same network. I believe, he acknowledged that. Going by his tweet later.
  =>Yesterday night, I believed no one came to stay at Samadhan. I did not see or heard scooter coming in later.
  =>I was wondering to wish Johnson, the Kerala lad in F5, since did not see him for long, and he appeared in the evening. Wished HNY, to Mikhil as well in the morning and also to Anant.
  => Power went off and thus sat down to jot in the dairy. I have yet to fill up all the pages of the Diary gifted by Dinesh / 0707.
  => Saw Zaaya, last evening, coming from Pernem Road, she did not acknowledge me, even though she saw me, and was kind of perplexed what to do. I did not either. She did not ping me on WA later, nor I did. Every Indian Girl/Woman is same here. FAKE>
  => I have to make a morning schedule. Did not go for walk, because it was Monday and hence "fishing holiday", but plan to go from tomorrow.Dying to eat MAkerel.
  => 1440 Not sleeping today afternoon.
  => Moved a few of the delicate plants at "Samadhan" to place which as a slighter less sunlight ratio.
  => I have internet, two laptops, I need not sleep in the afternoon. Evening I can reserve for cooking, chilling and sky-watching!
  => Just saw that WA has a new feature, "message to yourself." 1445
  => Pinged Rohit, HNY! I am not sure, but he would be in touch still with Zaaya, I guess! Zaaya never had anything to gain from me, after I left Gulzaar, my vanity was gone then and there. In fact, it is true for all the people whom I interacted with there. It was all "mean based" and superficial.
  ****Sawmya's birthday today. We just had a talk and also with Anish. 1512 hrs.
