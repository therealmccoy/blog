=> Last few days or may be couple of days, since Thursday, was distraught because the ACER laptop was again not working. Same problem, it won't just reboot. Thankfully, today morning, I tried and it started working again. At first I thought, that there would be disk issue, because last time, it was making a lot of noise, but thankfully, it's not the case. Was able to run the entire disk-check, without any errors.
Almost cried at it last night, because was not only feeling lonely but also helpless.

=> Did not go to the shore yesterday evening. Same weather.
