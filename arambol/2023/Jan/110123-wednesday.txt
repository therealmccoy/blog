=> Found a Rs.10 Note, just at the Bus Stand Optical shop. It was folded and quite dark over there, after returning from shore.

=> Aurelie came over, right where I was sitting, she saw me, and sat down to chat. First time, that a woman sat down and chatted with me. Later she called her on-and-off BF Vini, and when they started talking, I took excuse and left.

=> KRISHNA saw me coming back, while he was returning from Keri on scooter, turned around and hailed me down.We talked a bit, and he asked, why I was AWOL and I said, may be call it "Full Moon Effect". He gave me small Dairy Milk chocolate and later offered me to drop to Samadhan. He would have reached by now to BLR, was catching flight from Mopa.

He did not have anything to eat at Uncle's place. Said had cold and also conjuctivitis, took eyesdrop at Bus Stand.

=> The Sunset was gorgeous, almost a sinker. I reached late, because initially my plan was not to go to shore. Finished filling water and watering the plants late, and then the Karan guy(F2) was leaving for shore and so I requested him to drop me too as well.

=> Had Jhaal-Mudhi, minus tomatoes last night. Put Chaat-Masala.

=> Drank again, nip of Bullet at night, I don't know why I was feeling high. May be after talking to Aurelie.

=> So far, I have not written a post for Goa99 today, but don't want to break the streak. It's first time that I am logging here first than writing for Goa 99.

=> Was planning to start a new SubStack publication "whocareswhowins" for writing random stuff.

=> Have not read the emails or logged, for eons.

=> WATCHED : Thai Massage (Hindi) couple of days back. Loved it, not for the story but for the acting.

=> A small russian/ USSR boy came yesterday morning to see the G3 apartment for his grandmother. Very cute one. Gave him the Rs.10 Bourbon biscuit packet which I had bought for myself and both him & his father were so excited and happy. I felt really happy.

=> THE ADAMANT BULL : The small reddish-orange bull who comes to have garbage, was so adamant that he came thrice to eat the garbage. And while I chased him twice, later he was looking back, whether I continued or not. Freaking amazing. Earlier I hit him with a stone too and was feeling bad for it. But he came back again.

Now have put the dried Beri stems with thorns on the entrance. Feel a bit peaceful now.

=> I don't want to drink but since there is nothing much to do in the afternoon, so that's what I do. I want to stop it, but for the lack of a better vocation, that's what I do. 9th gone, 10th gone and today is 11th.

Now again, I am thinking, that I would start fasting from tomorrow, it would be perfect 11 day Fast, before 23rd. And fasting means, no smoking as well.

I would hae to do it, anyhow from tomorrow. I tell myself everyday, that this is the only "work" and the most important "work" that I need to do, but fail at it.
