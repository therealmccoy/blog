====================================

=> Day before yesterday, as I finished writing the log almost, BhaiSaab came. I thought he was here for a routine visit and did not expect him so early, because just a couple of days earlier than 1st, he came and gave me Rs.2,500/- as advance salary.

As I was wondering, how would be my NYE, he came and gave me money, most probably he knew that, I'd be wondering that also.

He was here to show the next door land to someonewhom he kew. He pointed to dirty railings (the white ones) and since I did not have much to do, I started cleaning them; even though his intructions have been to get it cleaned from the cleaning lady.

While leaving, he gave me Rs.2,000/- more from the January salary advance, as he must be thinking that I would have splurged the money previously given on NYE.Unlike everythime, when he makes me tally, how much money has been paid to me so far, for the month, he did not say anything to me. It's not that, I am taking it as a liberty (extra payment), but it elates me, that how now I can spend Rs.100/- per day; and live comfortably.

=> I was not supposed to drink, but then I went and bought a nip of Bullet; I spent Rs.240/- that day, which inluded Rs.90 on liquor and Rs.100 on cigarettes, which is like, yesterday, I felt terrible about it.

=> Was not planning to go to shore, but almost at the fag end of evening, decided to take a walk, because nothing much was to be done. As I was standing at Drum Circle, Krishna came and again started mocking about the music of "Drum Circle", it annoyed me to no end.

We romaed a lot that day, and as written in the "reflections-post", he kind of offered me INR 18LPA Job at BLR. We discussed this thing a lot. Went to German Bakery, then Fameaux and then finally to This IS It, and then to Lama bakery. 

Had, a Chicken Shwarma (1st time ever) and an Egg Omelet Sandwich at Dennis Falafel and Lama Bakery respectively.

My brain was so effed up by his talk, that I had to buy a nip of OM, even though I knew, that I wont be able to finish it at night, which of course I could not.

=> We made plans to visit Keri yesterday, but when I pinged him yesterday afternoon, whether he has taken the bike from his hostel owner, he said that he hs a call between 1500-1600 and did not provide any further information.

=> Again yesterday, while spending conservatively, because of the extra Rs.40 left over from DBY, bought a nip of Bullet and due to the mix of Bullet & OM; was i a different state in the evening, and did not feel like going to shore.

=> Just watched a couple of movies, "Double XL" a bit, then Finished "Madoff The Monster" which was released yesterday only.And then, fast forwarded "Mili" which was really an awful one, don't know, why people even make that kind of movies.

=> Though, planned to cook, in the evening, but due to the effect of alcohol and being engrossed in the MadOff series, just ate the potatoes which I boiled for cooking aaloo-Tamatar. I was supposed to go and buy the tomatoes, but one of those days, where I did not go out.

Krishna pinged in the evening around 1945, "Where?" to which I did not reply. I had no inclination or strength to listen to him again. 

=> WIN : Wrote 4th straight blog post on 99 Goa; and also wrote to "Reflections" post; which are there on GitHub,but don't know, where to post them. Probably a new blog?
