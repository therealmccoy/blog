**1st JUMMA & WOLF FULL MOON DAY**
==================================

=> Did not go to shore yesterday evening as well, 2nd day in a row. Mostly because, I did not want to interact with Krishna again.

=> After finishing up the writing of "99Goa" and "Arambol" post, went and fetched a nip of Bullet and Sundrops Oats(which I have come to like a lot.

=> MOVIES:

a.) The Man Of Action
b.) The Ruthless
c.) Thallaivi

=> Did not want to drink in the night, but the same thing happened, when I got up and thought that would start "No Smoking" & "No Drinking" movement from Friday, because it's the 1st Friday of the Yea, and also the 1st Full Moon (Wolf Moon), so that would be auspicious.

=> Had boiled the potatoes while watching the movies, and after I came back after having got OM & Cigarettes; I was on the computer for a while, because pump was running and I ws not sure, whether I wanted to cook or not, but then decided to cook only the "Aaloo-Tamatar".

=> ASAD (Gulzar) : He had pinged me DBY about joining Gulzar, part-time and I replied to him, that I am deep engrossed in R&A and won't be able to do so, before summer.

=> Had couple of small interactions with 16 month old Andreyushka, but could not play or talk to him much, because, he was busy, or rather in a hurry with her parents.

=> Shifted the couple of flower plant, small pots to the steps of SAMADHAN, and just about a day after noticed that, the rose plant on the right first step, which has not yet bloomed ever, has started blooming. Wondering whether it is due to the "company"?

=> I am not keeping the count of words that I have typed on the blogs,as there are only 2 blogs being active, so I would make it a weekly affair only (logging the words) on Monday.

=> The most happy thing is that, I am writing regularily.

=> Today early morning, probably a big bull, whom earlier I have chased away from Samadhan, because he would throw around the garbage kept outside, came and threw astrew all the garbage bags and made a mess, a sore to the eye. He also pissed big time, because there was a big "wet mark" near the cardboard-box.

=> Now, I don't even remember when was the last time, did I take bath with water, the last dip I had was on 31st Dec eve. And probably, I saw something to this effect in the dreams.

=> Used the pink gloves(3M), which I bought for fishing in 2017 Monsoon, for the first time after "Mickey's Landing, here today morning, in order to pu the strewn garbage bag in the large garbage bag.

=> Now, as I have exhausted the 3 cigarettes left over, of lst night, in quick succession, thinking I wont smoke more, I am mulling, going and buying cigarettes and probably a nip of Bullet, and start my fast, from tomorrow, because the "Full Moon" would occur in the evening.

=> JUST REALISED : I have spent so much of money since starting on Salary again here at "Slot In The Wall", and yet so far have not cooked a my favourite sandwiches in the sandwich maker. Huh! 
WHAT A FAIL!
