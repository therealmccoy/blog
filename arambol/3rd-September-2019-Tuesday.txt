I have been going to Saibini prayer everyday. I did not go last year, because I was kind of angry at the 'reality' of these people around, which I saw. I mean greed everywhere and then in front of the God, they behave as if , the only thing which they care about in this world is the piece of mind.

After many months, I finished a book in less than 2 days. And the book is the 'The Perks Of Being A WallFlower' by Chobsky. I remember only his last name. I saw that book's reference on the tweet of @AdiCrazy and then immediately downloaded it and proceeded to read it. I believe I finished it in about 6 odd hours.

For last 2 days, the lunch has been absolutely amazing due to the Ganpati festival going on. First day, even though Patrem called me over, but he was slightly late, as by then then the little boy Arabian was already at my door, and since there was this opportunity available to participate in the Aarti also, so I went over there. Amazing food. If such amazing vegetarian food is available, why would anyone crave for anything except the fish.

Today is the 6th day that Francis boat has not went out, due to rains, and wind and of course because of lack of fishes. Had it been the Prawns season, then they would have surely went out, but for the fish worth Rs.2,000-3,000, who wants to take the risk.

Sanjay.K is kind of sadistic person, he takes pleasure in the mis-fortune of other people. It seems that it gives him some kind of solace, that if he is not happy (according to his definition of status, and material wealth) , then it is good that others are also not. Also, because of this fact that he tries to be over-smart in about trying to get access to my thoughts and whereabouts, I have begun to detest him now. HAd it not been about the withdrawal of cash, then I would not have even looked once towards him.

Yesterday, as I was at Dabholkar's, all of a sudden after lunch, the Seion one told me that how they do not have anyone at their house, who drinks, and I took it as a SIGNAL.I had been having kind of small-pain in the left side of the stomach, when even then on Saturday I had a nip of Feni and a nip of Old Monk (That was to tell myself nth time, that I am quitting it from tomorrow, also because Saturday was 31st of August). I did not have any alcohol, or as 'NOAL' which I put in my calendar, today is the 3rd day.

Now, I have filed 2 consecutive IT Returns, and I believe it is the HOLY GRAIL of my life. My last AY earnings is mere Rs.62,897.

I have been logged out of Twitter for the 3rd day today (would complete it at zero hundred in baout 3 hours time).
