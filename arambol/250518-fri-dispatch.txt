As I was coming back from Mapusa to Arambol in morning by bus, on the turn towards Harmal at the highest point of Mandrem-Harmal road; I saw the sea to be dark grey and wild waves forging towards shore. It had been cloudy and quite dense too, in morning and looked like it would pour, specially with increase in humidity levels, but it did not eventually.

At evening, really strong winds started blowing from north. As I went to shore in the evening, I experienced the strongest winds of the season. Wite sand was getting blown away for hundreds of feet and fishermen were busy pulling their boats up, further on the ridge lines of the sore. Had it been like last year,I would have gone to push, but now almost all of the fishermen have the winch powered by diesel engine.

The sea was wild to say the least, it was like an aftermath of a heavy stormy night; clouds were hanging around, but with such strong winds, it was difficult that it would rain. Though, I am yet to be an expert in this. Sometimes strong winds do really bring thunder and showers like that it was on 10th May.

I stood on the shore till the sun set down and managed to dodge the occasional "outlier" wave. My dog friend, came around and poked his nose on my leg, sitting down besides me and I patted him for few minutes.

The winds never subsided and only grew wild,a nd they were blowing pretty hard till 2030 hrs. Though they blew away the clouds and moon was out shining in all it's splendour. The nearby street lights were not working and it made the moon much more magical.
