## Started : 0950 hrs.

It has been raining almost the entire night and due to the tin-roof above and the tip-tap sound being made by the raindrops, even when they are not too heavy, means a lot of bother sometimes, specially when you are trying to sleep.

It is so amazing that, I started the m/c and did not proceed to check SM. I went to the shore and today is the 7th day, that none of the boats have been out. The last day, that boats went out was 28th August 2019. such weather is expected to last this entire week. the wind has changed and North-Westerly is again blowing.

Since it was dark, due to electricity being MIA, in order to bid time, I decided to cook food. I don't know why, I did not try to write in the notebook, may be I was not in the mood. Electricity was back in about 90 odd minutes. 

I am going to buy a new candle for Rs.10 tonight.

The Felix guest-house opposite, is building the roof on the fourth floor, and it seems they are building only one room and leaving the rest as sitting area. That's nice, that shall give me opportunity :-)

It is so surprising that Patrem instead of asking for rent from me, have been so kind to to me, yesterday evening, he was even asking about, whether I need a scooter to go to market (though i know that was deliberate, because he knows that i never go on to market by scooter) hrs. 

I have started time-logging back on Toggl and it seems fun again.

I don't really want to burst the crackers which the 'Taklu Fisherman' has given to me, along with Rs.100 bucks. If it keeps on raining, then I could excuse myself. And as if on a cue, it has stopped raining. It's kind of an impediment if I want to have 'LONG PURSUITS', specially since I dont have to cook now.

It has started raining sufficiently strong, for me, to validly skip the 'bursting cracker parade' and i am happy. little less pollution and peace of mind. Last night the folks of 'Leela Guest House' were bursting crackers till late in the night, like complete buffoons, even when there was no electricity. Some people get solace, in some really strange ways.

I ave got invitation for LUNCH from little boy Arabian. Which means, I will have to skip the lunch at Budkes. He does not call me for dinner, though he said that do not cook either for lunch or dinner, when the Ganpati was about to start.

It's been dark like evening since afternoon, specially just after the moment i returned from Dabholkar's after having delicious LUNCH, the second one in last 3 days. It's been raining almost continuously. The lunch today had also 'Gaothi' Bhindi and I could have ate a hell lot more, than I did. IT also had Poori and I believe, I had a dozen of them, they were small, like 3cms in dia. It's been continuously raining heavily since I came back and it has not abetted, which means no outing.

Since the Felix GH construction sis going in full swing today and those boys make a hell lot of noise, there is no point in even opening the door and sitting out. Both the door and window is closed, and only the night bulb is on.

Today's book is 'To Kill A Mocking Bird', perhaps I will make some black tea now and light the Agarbatti.

Bhajan Mandli from Sawantwadi came to Dabholkar's and I attended the ceremony. The folks came late due to heavy rains enroute. It was too good. I had 1 Samosa and 2 Plates of Samosa. Prior to the ceremony, I had tea and 2 Karanji / Ghujia.
