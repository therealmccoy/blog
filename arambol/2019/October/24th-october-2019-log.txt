Mickey has created a 'Google Form' today to get subscribers for his 'Private Newsletter'. 

Like everything else, this too is just an experiment. More so than anything else, it is about getting a sort of 'legitimacy' of the readers. I mean, if you want to read, then get 'in'.

I mean, if you can subscribe for Netflix and pay for it, and if you really value whatever I have been doing or writing, then at least subscribe for it. It does not mean that I am not asking you to 'Not Pay' yet.

With this 'Newsletter', I believe, I have found the perfect balance between 'Tweeting and 'Logging'. This way, I have at least some kind of semblance of 'who' is reading my blog (People who are 'invisibly' reading my blog, talking about being 'invisible') and when I feel like I do not want to share my life for the sake of 'consumption' of others, I did not need to stop tweeting; I did not need to de-activate or 'lock' my twitter.

1053 :: The Fire-Brigade vehicle just went past ML, blaring siren. the only reason could be a house collapse or a tree fell on some house.

1059 :: It is raining heavily, like "Bulls & Bears" right now. Thankfully, the electricity is still switched 'On', which I am not sure, whether is the same story elsewhere or not. It has been consistently raining 'non-stop' since last night, which has liked not happened more than once may be, this entire rainy season. This is due to this severe cyclonoc storm which is moving kind of North-East right now and may make a head-fall somewhere at Gujarat or so.

The trouble with rain is that I can't listen to music with all that noise coming from the tin-roof.

1201 :: Tried setting up the newsletter with Mailchimp, but after tinkering with design and all, it says that, no more audience could be created as the limit has been already reached, well, that could have been an alert banner, while creating a new campaign, so that people can get 2 know. So ditched it, and now experiencing it with Revue. For the 1st time.
Created a lot of Logos, Covers and profiles already for 'R2A'

It has not stopped raining since then. I wanted to have like another cup of tea, but it is almost the 'lunch time' now.

It is so elegant to switch-off the 'line count' in sublime, it's like suddenly one has so much wider space available to play. Loving it. Activated it just today.

1213 :: At least, after a long-time, I would be back to 'commiting'. I was so diligent for so many days, and now again, I am haywire.

1216 :: Giving the lame excuse of 'career ambitious' for failed or unsuccessful relationships is so bull-shit. Poor people forget the trade-off, life is all about trade-off. For once, do not make stupid trade-offs and if you make it, do not give lame excuse for it. C'mon grow up silly.

1228 :: Though the rains would not last long any more, but is still heartening that I would not have to go far too collect grocery, when it is raining constantly. I am still in a fix, to cook what for the lunch?

1327 :: Sometimes I wonder, how could be some employees be so arrogant and naive, as if they are running the world. Like this stupid OYO ABM. This clearly makes it evident, the company is being run a group of Charlies, whose sole motive is to only shore up the valuation and make a buck.

Took umbrella and went to the 'stones-throw' grocery shop next to ML (the audit guys came, as I was about there) and bought, Rs.10 each worth of Kaanda,Batata and Tamatar. Also, bought, probably the last pack of 'available', Kaanda-Lehsun Chutney. Rice is on stove and vegetables cut.

1333 :: The ONLY WAY to have a free mind is to earn livelihood, which has the least chances of having it to sell it to someone in order to do so (earn livelihood).
