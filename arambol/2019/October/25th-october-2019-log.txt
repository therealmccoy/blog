1050 :: I de-activated Twitter last night, but got back again on it at sometime around 1000 or so. And the reason is amply evident, that because of the rains, I do not have nothing better to do.
There has not been any electricity since God knows when, and I am running on 'Inverter' back-up. thankfully, there are no Guests as of now, except the T1T2 top-floor Georgians, else the power would not have lasted so much.
Had a cup of tea (black obvious, without lemon; which I have not bought for God knows till when).
The IMD images of 1011 look ominous so far, though it is not raining heavily and no winds also so far.
Sent the 1st issue of the newsletter to myself.

1053 :: In these days, when the kids minds are morphed a lot by what they see around, which is beyond the control of the parents, or rather they cannot control it inadvertently; it is essential that Kids see the world gone by through the eyes of their parents too. That shall help them see the the perspective of their parents and help bridge the gap, which develops so soon, as either of them fail to identify with each other's world. 

Photographs are 1 of the ways to let the kids experience their world of the past, but the problem with photographs is that they do not come with the narrative, one can try to build a narrative through them, but it is more often than not, lost-in-translation. But while with words, one can build a picture as grand as one wants. And that's why the narrative always wins. Words over Photographs, ALWAYS.

1104 :: It seems, all through my life, I have been posting the things on my various blogs, just for the sake of my (would be) kids. So that they can have a look and have a ready-made reference of 'who' and 'how' their father was. The problem with first-hand narrative is that, people usually don't believe it (specially in 2day's Netflix world, even the real life, looks fiction to them) and it's specially true for kids. they take it as if something is being made-up for them to relent. In between breath, they ask meekly, where is the evidence, that what you are saying is true?

And that's where all these forms of Logs (Including Twitter) and Blog come in, and are the best ones. 
They are a 3rd person narrative of the first person. 
Nothing could be better than them. 
There is no reason for anyone to refute them, it has already happened and since it is being logged, it's the proof itself that it is true and not being made-up. Do you need anything else to convince a kid, that her Dad had an amazing life and there could be such a life as well? 
Apparently, No!

1125 :: The 1057 image of IMD still looks ominous and now it looks like the cyclone is definitely moving straight to ML. I have switched-off the light, in order to save the 7W or so of electricity even. I also hope that Georgians of T1T2 are not splurging on electricity either. 

1133 :: There has been slight lull in rains and a few people are taking full advantage of it. I am also going to have another cup of black-tea. I have also posted a few excerpts from this post on Twitter. This is like seed-feeding, to make them know that there are interesting stuff inside the newsletter. I am not going to do it everyday, but every once and now, to let them know that they are missing something.
