I dis-continued or de-activated the Twitter account (again) last night.
I am going to re-activate it again only on 9th November 2019 (if I am alive by then) or later when the first dance at 'The Source'. Certainly not before 9th November, that would complete the 6 months hiatus. The original plan was 7 months, but it did not happen, anyways.
Got a nip of Uraak from Abhay's bar after a really long time, i thought better to have Uraak, than 90 of Old Monk, which I ahd last night, after completing almost 3 days without alcohol.

Just wrote a reminder to Ashish Sinha of NBW about the payment for 1st and 2nd May work. I would keep on sending him polite reminders on a weekly basis, till he sends me the payment. Rs.1500 means, I can survive for 15 days, it matters a lot to me.

I have to learn to fake the 'respect' just for the sake of my own survival [see in context of previous sentence], if this would not have been the survival issue, i would not have done it.

The kids start asking about going to beach for playing cricket, right at the moment they saw me first time. I am still not being able to fathom out the reason for it?

Made Dal-Fry after a very long time, I do not even know, when I cooked it last night. Went looking for Drumsticks but could not find it anywhere, not even at the vegetable store.

The corner veggie shop finally folded, which means, long walk for even Rs.10 worth of veggie.

From today, I would seriously start working on Quora's Partner Program of 'Asking Questions', I guess now with Aadhaar Card copy, there would not be any hassle in accepting payments with Paypal.
