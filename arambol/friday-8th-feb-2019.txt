1. I don’t think that I have ever talked to a woman so much in a very long time, may be after 2008, as I talk with Mira of Montegro nowadays.
I ask her for tea, whenever I have some. Like today morning. She also showed me the video of Montenegro from Beautiful Montenegro site.

2. Sanjay came asking me, if I require any help, for breakfast and all. He looks to be more kind, since he learned that I don’t have work, which I told him day before yesterday. He had offer me the Samosa gig, for which I agreed.
But because of this sprain in the right leg since Sunday, I have not gone to beach for almost a week now and hence has not been able to speak to the Rodrigues, the head of lifeguard guy.

3. I de-activated Twitter yesterday and now, I do not want to go back to it. Like, seriously. THough, I am still following M's tweets.

4. Room was broomed for the first time after 24th January and I sent a SMS to Josh regarding this. He called me up then and informed me about the new Tata Mega XL vehicle delivery of Maverick enterprises. We then also discussed about his plan to go fishing at a place called Badul, near Chiplun. He said, that he could arrange an old smartphone for me. We talked for a long while since he left on two Saturdays back.

5. Mira informed me that she is going for a walk to beach and then would bring some vegetables and make a salad and Buckwheat combo kind of thing, she left around 11am and she has just returned as i was writing this at 1433.
