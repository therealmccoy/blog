1) i had a Nip of IB in the afternoon, goong over and above the Rs.100 daily budget. I fooled myself once again, that for this Saturday and Sunday, I would keep the budget at Rs.150 for each day.

2) Made only Aaloo Subji, kind of Bhujia, but due to the Alumunium Kadhai, it never cooks as it should be. It did not turn as bad in the end, as I feared.

Had more than half of it with IB and rest with rice.

3) Did not go to beach, somehow was not feeling well, though I ahd lunch at 1430 and woke up at around 1710. It has been cloudy and dull soon after I woke up.

4) Tried to watch the remaining part of ‘Lakshya’ movie, but it becomes a real burden at times, you want to watch it also and then don’t as well.

5) Checked the NBW’s slack account and finally found it de-activated. After 10 days, since Ashish said, he would deactivate it.

He has again changed the format / content strategy of the website. Gone are the collections, Ha ha ah !

6) It drizzled like just for a couple of seconds, thankfully no more humid and hot.

7) As I was thinking of quitting drinking, went to have bath, after watching almost the entire ‘Lakshya’, came out and Sanjay offered to celebrate, the kind of first rain.

So inadvertently, going to drink again.

8) I guess, I would keep it now for the first month to only Saturdays and Sundays?

9) I desperately want to get in the groove and form again !
