Well, posting this after eons here.There is so much to log down, but do not know, why I did not do, perhaps due to lack of a working machine.

So, today on Chhoti-Diwali, Anant got a new VU TV, I helped it install and avoided an extra cost of Rs.3,700 to him, in the form of the TV Stand, which was not required, but which was being sold by the installation guy.

So, I earned the Rs.300 which he allowed me to keep yesterday.

Money is bigger or Brains, then it is definitely Brains.

Also, those who have Money, necessarily do not have common-sense, because they have not earned their money with common-sense, but the usual brute way of "Zero-Sum Game".

I believe, those who earn money, with the "Positive Sum Game" frame of mind, still have common-sense; but it is so very difficult to find such people, now-a-days.

I do not have any expectations from them for Diwali, and unless invited, would most probably fast, and I do not really mind it.
