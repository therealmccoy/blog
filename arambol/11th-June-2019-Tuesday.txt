It has been an entirely windy and rainy day to say so. Though it did not rain really after 0700 or so, it has been cloudy ever since the entire day.
Today's most important agenda was to visit Vision Hospital again for the dressing of elder Budke, and surprisingly somehow I was not really keen on that. May be it was the weather.
We came back and after a while I went to the market, to spend my daily budget of Rs.50 and I took exactly the same amount and Rs.10 more in change, which was lying on the refrigerator.
It was the day of "Number 0" and I was happy. I kept it soaked a while in water, in the meanwhile I cooked rice. Since I ahd Rs.50 left with me of Monday, suddenly I had this temptation to buy a "90" of Old Monk and have it with lunch.
Monday was as it is "NOAL" which meant "No Alchohol Day", a rarity in last few months.

Went to the shore in the evening, after it stopped drizzling. There was no beach left, water was up to the Love shack, huge hurling waves, dark grey water. I stood there for a while, but then three young labourers came over there and destroyed my meditation and then I decided to went back. The sky did not look too ominous though.

Came back and decided to finish the left over "90" of Old Monk and started watching "Badhai Ho", which I found to be a rather nice movie. ANd then I went back and bought another "90" and 2 packs of Maggi. And there went away my savings of Rs.50 and I went over and spent an extra Rs.50 too.

But I am hell-bent on keeping my budget at Rs.50.

Later on I watched "Baby" again, though I have watched it earlier also.

After pinging Anil Pandey regarding the SIS vacancy, I wrote to the concerned HR person also, and then she asked the usual thing to send me over the CV. Anil Pandey asked me to call him, but I am no mood for small-talk, they would not understand me and I would not understand them.
