* As I woke up today, I consciously reminded myself of the fact that, today is a Saturday and I am in Goa and sang my own little song for it happily.
* Today is the second consecutive day that I am writing again this post, even though the earlier one ie of yesterday was incomplete.
* Somehow, I really like putting in entries on Calendar. They are terse and swift and do their job. The real 'logs'.
* For the first time ever, bought 'Kaju Feni' from the corner shop 'Prakash Bar & Restaurant' at market. I was expecting it to be at Rs.20 but it turned out to be at Rs.30
* Got Soda to go with it, as I could not imagine myself, drinking Feni with water.
* I am having 'Feni' as I start typing this sentence, mixed with Soda. It seems quite potent, but may be because of the fact that, I have not topped it, only half-full.
* I see a glimmer of hope, that I would get employed with NBW again, post the payment made by Ashish Sinha yesterday of Rs.1080 and I know the reason why he made that particular amount of payment.
** I have started asking questions under the Quora Partner Program today.
** 15 Questions asked in less than about hour. A couple of them garnering huge numbers already (+250 in views)
* I feel like sharing this new vocation of mine with Josh, but I do not think, he would understand. This is what you call being 'lonely' actually.
*** 2112 views on 15 questions in less than a hour on Quora Partner Program.
* I had mangoes also (4 of them, which I picked from Dabholkar's tree)after having lunch. Ate all the fried potatoes, that was half kg of them.
* This Kaju Feni is quite potent, I really liked it. A nip of it is equivalent to at least two nips of Old Monk. I am going to get one more nip tomorrow.
* Ivon, Saby brought in their bigger boats, which would be deployed form tomorrow. The sea has been quite wild and noisy since a week or so. The wind never subsided. I helped push the boats.
** If it starts working, then this "Quora Partner Program" is the 'PERFECT' vocation for me, keep on researching and reading and basis on that keep on asking questions. And I am not dependent on anybody else, except myself. Woah !!!
* It is 2031 and I am having green tea after a very long time, after bath. I have decided to have green tea post coming back from beach in the evening, this would help me starting off with 16 hours fast. I can discount myself a cup of green tea.
* The doggy of Rukmini (@stopmininow) died either yesterday or early today morning. I did not log in to Twitter.
* Had Katra-Paav and Pyaaz-Tamatar-Namak at night, as I went walking, I picked up 8 mangoes in all. One of them fall right when I was there.
